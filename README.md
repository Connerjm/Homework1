# Homework1
A repository for the first assignment in the coding bootcamp. Horiseon Web Page.

My task was to refactor given code to fix a few mistakes and simplify and pretty-up the code itself.

I added a lot of comments. Consolidated some CSS rules that were redundent. Switched the order of the rules to be easier to understand. Changed a few tags to be semantic rather then just div. I also added a minimum width so that the header wont squish and push elements down. Fixed the link that was broken.
